# ClubSecurity

A teaching platform aimed at non-technically savvy people that teaches computer security best practices.


## Installation Instructions

I've set up this application with the open source seed application accessible at https://github.com/angular/angular-seed. The benefits of using this seed application is that it sets up our web server and all of our folders for us and comes with a built in testing framework.

Please follow the instructions at the angular seed repo to set up this application for development on your computer starting at the header "Install Dependencies"!
