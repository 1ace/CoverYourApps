He will focus his endorsement on her long time work helping our veterans, as well as her foreign policy background. Ben on the surrogates team will help him refine his op-ed, and we will place it on his behalf. <br><br> Very good discussion. Also says post endorsement, he's happy to help with any \"Republicans for Hillary\" organizing activities, and also happy to help us in the Mormon community. <br><br> He's also requesting your personal phone number for future communication about Republican backing of our campaign--mind sending that over? <br><br> Thanks! <br>Adrienne"
